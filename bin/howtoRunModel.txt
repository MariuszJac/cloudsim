SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since model requires hardcoded (not relative ones!) paths to folders this means that in order to make the simulation model run, you need to do a little bit of extra work of defining paths to all the important folders.
All steps required are explained below!

1. Update in /bin/runModel.bat file update 'simplatformConfigurationFilePath' parameter to point to the bin/configuration.txt location in your installation folder.
2. Create 'bootstrap' and 'results' folder in location of your choice. In 'bootstrap' folder we put data generated from metric extractor, where 'results' folder keeps data generated by the simulation model. 
	Both bootstrap and results folder names are user-defined and can be located in any place. To tell the model where these folders are located, follow step 3 below.
3. Under /bin folder in 'configuration.txt' file update the locations to 'bootstrapDataFolderLocation', 'resultsFolderLocation'.
	In addition, update the path to 'batchFolderLocation'. This folder is located under /bin folder of your installation and is used to store model configurations that are used during simulation process.
